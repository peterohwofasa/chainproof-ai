└── public/
    └── chainproof-logo.png                   # Logo for PDF reports
```

## Dependencies

- **jsPDF** (`^3.0.3`): PDF generation library
- **Next.js** (`^15.5.5`): Framework
- **NextAuth** (`^4.24.7`): Authentication
- **Radix UI**: Modal/dialog components
- **Lucide React**: Icons
- **Sonner**: Toast notifications

## Configuration

### Logo Setup
Place your ChainProof logo at:
```
public/chainproof-logo.png
```

Recommended specs:
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Dimensions: 800x200px or similar aspect ratio
- File size: < 100KB

### Authentication
PDF downloads require:
- Valid NextAuth session
- User must own the audit being downloaded

### Demo Mode
Users without full accounts (`canSaveOrExport === false`) will:
- See disabled download buttons
- Receive error message when attempting to download
- Be prompted to sign in with full account

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
1. **401 Unauthorized**: User not logged in
2. **403 Forbidden**: User doesn't own the audit
3. **404 Not Found**: Audit ID doesn't exist
4. **500 Internal Server Error**: PDF generation failed

### User-Friendly Messages
- "Failed to generate PDF report" (toast notification)
- "Failed to download PDF report" (console error + toast)
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Sign in** with Base Account or regular credentials
2. **Submit a contract** for audit
3. **Wait for completion** - verify modal appears
4. **Download PDF** from modal - verify:
   - Logo appears in PDF
   - All sections present
   - Data matches audit results
   - Filename is correct
5. **View full report** - verify navigation works
6. **Download from results page** - verify both PDF and JSON work

### Edge Cases to Test
- Audit with no vulnerabilities (should show success message)
- Audit with many vulnerabilities (pagination in PDF)
- Very long vulnerability descriptions (text wrapping)
- Missing logo file (should fall back to text header)
- Demo mode user (should block downloads)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Email PDF option** - Send report via email
2. **Multiple format options** - CSV, DOCX, etc.
3. **Custom branding** - Allow users to add their own logo
4. **Report templates** - Different formats for different audiences
5. **Comparison reports** - PDF showing before/after audits
6. **Scheduled reports** - Automatic report generation and delivery
7. **Blockchain verification** - Store report hash on-chain
8. **IPFS storage** - Decentralized report storage

### Performance Optimizations
1. Cache generated PDFs for faster re-downloads
2. Background PDF generation for large reports
3. Progressive PDF generation for real-time preview
4. PDF streaming for large documents

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'jspdf'"
Run: `npm install jspdf`

### Logo not appearing in PDF
1. Verify file exists at `public/chainproof-logo.png`
2. Check file permissions
3. Ensure file is readable (not corrupted)
4. Try converting to PNG if using different format

### PDF download fails silently
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint returns 200 status
3. Check Content-Type header is `application/pdf`
4. Ensure Content-Disposition header is set correctly

### Modal doesn't appear
1. Verify `showCompletionModal` state updates
2. Check `auditResult` and `auditId` are set
3. Ensure `AuditCompleteModal` component is imported
4. Check console for React errors

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Review API response in Network tab
3. Verify authentication status
4. Check file permissions for logo
5. Consult this documentation
